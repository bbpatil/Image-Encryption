% Points = EllipticCurvePointsModp3Mod4(a, b, p)
% Input:  Two integers a, b, and a prime p > 3.  It is assumed that 4a^3 +
% 27b^2 is nonzero, so that the associated elliptic curve
%         y^2 = x^3 + ax + b
%is nonsingular.
% Output:  Points, a 2 column vector listing all points belonging to this
% elliptic curve mod p, including the point at infinity.  Each row of
% points will be a point on this elliptic curve.
% The method will simply run through all possible values for x (mod p),
% compute the right side r = x^3 + ax + b, and check to see whether
% r^(p+1)/4 (mod p) is a square root of r.
